# Maze-Solver
Final project for AP Computer Science A (2018)


The program is designed to randomly generate a maze and to determine if it is solvable from a certain starting point. The user determines the dimensions of the maze, and can generate multiple mazes before deciding to continue with one. The maze itself, while not necessarily conventional, is simple and easy to comprehend. It is not a perfect maze by definition, and it thus may or may not be solvable from a given point. From there, the user inputs a starting point, and the program solves the maze. Interactive and straightforward, Maze: Generate and Solve applies recursion in an interesting way.
